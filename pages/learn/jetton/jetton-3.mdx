### Jetton tact demo project

Take example of project from GitHub:

```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/ton-community/tact-jetton
cd tact-jetton
```

### Minter
In `jetton.tact` defines minter contract, that will deploy initial contracts of jetton wallets with special "Mint" message.
Minter, usually used before Token become using by users, to distribute to all owners. In current case, we will deliver all Tokens to one owner and instantly deactivate option of mint again.
Look briefly to our contract:


```tact filename="sources/jetton.tact" copy
import "@stdlib/jetton";

message Mint {
    amount: Int;
}

contract SampleJetton with Jetton {

    totalSupply: Int as coins;
    owner: Address;
    content: Cell?;
    mintable: Bool;

    init(owner: Address, content: Cell?) {
        self.totalSupply = 0;
        self.owner = owner;
        self.mintable = true;
        self.content = content;
    }

    receive(msg: Mint) {
        let ctx: Context = context();
        self.mint(ctx.sender, msg.amount, ctx.sender);
    }

    receive("Mint!") {
        let ctx: Context = context();
        self.mint(ctx.sender, 1000000000, ctx.sender);
    }
}
```
In general, this contract receive "Mint" message, and if it happens he invoke mint() function,
that declared in `@stdlib/jetton`. mint() create message and send it to new jetton-wallet contract address.

1. _Wallet App A_ send request to _Wallet A_ send mint message to minter. Currently Minter does not exist in blockchain.
2. _Wallet A_ send "Mint" message to Minter's contract address. When it delivered, Minter become deployed and invoke in its mint() function.
3. _Minter_ send to _Jetton A_ address Transfer message with token's supply value. When it delivered, Jetton A contract become deployed.

### Deployment of jetton wallets for new users
Similar process happens when user of _Wallet App A_, want to send tokens to user of _Wallet App B_.
The trick is, our contract Jetton always send information and the whole code to another address. When it comes to destination, code executes and from case was it deployed before or already deployed.
In this case - [transfer](https://github.com/ton-core/tact/blob/main/stdlib/libs/jetton/messages.tact#L1) jetton message become the initial message at same moment and deploys Jetton B smart contract.

From [jetton/wallet.tact](https://github.com/ton-core/tact/blob/main/stdlib/libs/jetton/wallet.tact#L38), we can see, that it will create initial data for new jetton wallet contract:

```tact filename="wallet.tact"
//previous code

       let init: StateInit = initOf JettonDefaultWallet(self.master, msg.destination);
        let walletAddress: Address = contractAddress(init);
        send(SendParameters{
            to: walletAddress, 
            value: 0,
            mode: SendRemainingValue, 
            bounce: true,
            body: TokenTransferInternal{
                amount: msg.amount,
                queryId: msg.queryId,
                from: self.owner,
                responseAddress: self.owner,
                forwardTonAmount: msg.forwardTonAmount,
                forwardPayload: msg.forwardPayload
            }.toCell(),
            code: init.code,
            data: init.data
        });
        
```

Here, `initOf` allows to calculate new contract's init data.
It calculates from address of regular `Wallet B`, here `msg.destination` and address of Token master contract `self.master`. Because of that we always now both, we can now what address we will use as destination.


To display all data clear, application should read each element of process with get methods. It is job, that, for example, have to do blockchain explorers.

### Deployment of tact.jetton

This project has ready-made example of script for deploying jetton in testnet. Specify following things: 

* Input your deployment Testnet wallet seed in `tact-jetton/sources/jetton.deploy.ts`:
```ts filename="sources/jetton.deploy.ts"
  // Insert your test wallet's 24 words, make sure you have some test Toncoins on its balance. Every deployment spent 0.5 test toncoin.
  let mnemonics = "multiply voice predict admit hockey fringe flat bike napkin child quote piano";
```

* Input owner address at same `jetton.deploy.ts`:
```ts filename="sources/jetton.deploy.ts"
  // Owner should usually be the deploying wallet's address.
  let owner = Address.parse('kQDND6yHEzKB82ZGRn58aY9Tt_69Ie_uz73e2V...');
```
* Note, that in deployment script using walletV4. If you want use your V3R2, you need change wallet contract here.

* Run deployment script
```bash copy
  yarn deploy
```

As a result of successfully deployment, you should deploy two contracts:
* Minter, Token Master - [example](https://testnet.ton.cx/address/EQDupHQXvagCZ3RpkeMZ0dQMI2ACY-jowmCZQ_Y84aSqKw-Z).
* Jetton Wallet of first owner, Wallet A - [example](https://testnet.ton.cx/address/EQA7EdSn6hMMwC7g01w2FwtiZuJE7GZCxss7n3MD26nD6S65).
